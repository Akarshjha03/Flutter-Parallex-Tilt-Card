## 🚀 Project Description

Parallax Tilt Card is a Flutter application demonstrating advanced UI engineering without external dependencies. It implements a custom 3D rendering pipeline using Matrix4 transformations and accelerometer-mimicking gesture control. The project features custom shaders for dynamic lighting, golden glitter particle effects using BlendMode.overlay, and physics-based spring animations for realistic interaction.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Flutter
- **Language:** Dart
- **Rendering:** Skia / Impeller
- **Techniques:** 
  - `Matrix4` for 3D Perspective Transformations
  - `AnimationController` for Spring Physics
  - `ShaderMask` & `BlendMode.overlay` for Glitter/Gold Effects
  - `LinearGradient` for Holographic Shimmer

## ✨ Features
- **3D Parallax Tilt**: Card rotates based on gesture interaction with realistic perspective.
- **Physical Feedback**: Spring-based recoil animation when released.
- **Golden Aesthetics**: Custom shaders mimic gold reflection and glitter.
- **Dynamic Lighting**: Light sheen moves across the surface responding to tilt angle.

## 🚀 Performance
- **60fps/120fps Ready**: Optimized render loop using standard Flutter widgets.
- **Zero External Dependencies**: Built entirely with core Flutter primitives for maximum efficiency and small app size.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- [ ] Gyroscope support for device-tilt control (Mobile).
- [ ] Configurable tilt sensitivity.
- [ ] More archetype cards (The Rock, Cody Rhodes, etc.).

## 🗺️ StoryTelling

### ☝️ Roman Reigns’ 1316-Day Reign of Terror: A GOAT-Level Dynasty

Eyes locked like a final boss.
Paul Heyman selling every breath as history unfolding.

When his music hit, the crowd didn’t cheer or boo **they acknowledged.**

The Bloodline became the greatest storytelling weapon WWE ever used, with Heyman as the narrator of a dynasty.

This wasn’t just a long reign. it was **GOATED performance.**
Every title defense told a chapter.
Every promo felt like prophecy.

1316 days wasn’t impressive because of numbers, it was impressive because it never felt stale.

By the end, Roman Reigns wasn’t just a champion, he was a once-in-a-generation character WWE rarely gets. 🐐🔥
